Welcome back, Survivors! In today’s episode we take a look back at survivor history and discuss the Mary Ellen Wilson case: the first successful prosecution of child abuse in the United States! Poor Mary Ellen Wilson was treated like less than a dog by her adoptive parents and eventually the ASPCA stepped in to help because if we’re gonna protect animals we might as well try to protect children too? Trigger Warning: Child abuse, Domestic Abuse, Sexual Abuse
