News & Updates! 

+ Cosby found guilty on all counts of aggravated sexual assault in retrial! Go Andrea Constand! 

+ The Golden State Killer found and caught at last! Go Michelle McNamara! And the police who got him I guess? 

Personal Note: 

+ Our eviction continues. Our landlord has progressed to quasi-stalking behaviors now. 

FEATURED SURVIVOR: Patrick Stewart! 

His father beat his mother all through his childhood and he's been an activist campaigning against domestic violence for a million years! Patrick Stewart! Captain Picard! Sir Patrick! It doesn't take two to make a fight! Violence is an unacceptable way to deal with conflict! Mrs Dixon, the only person who ever stood up to his father! Look up Refuge, the UK-based domestic violence charity Patrick Stewart supports! Listen to Oliver ramble disjointedly and utterly fail to do a Patrick Stewart impression! 

*** 

We forgot to do our outro so I'll do it here: 

There's a war going on. 

And in the immortal words of Audre Lorde, "Your silence will not protect you."
