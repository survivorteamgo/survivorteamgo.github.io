Welcome back, Survivors! This week we discuss the current events surrounding Dr. Ford and the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings and remember back to 27 years ago when this exact same shit happened with Anita Hill. Join us while we learn about and celebrate the bravery and self sacrifice of these incredible survivors and their attempts if not to bring their attackers to justice, to at the very least keep them from holding life time appointments on the highest court in this country. Trigger Warning: child abuse, rape, attempted rape, sexual harassment, “false” rape allegations, pedophilia
