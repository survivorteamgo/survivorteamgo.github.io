Welcome back, Survivors! In this surprisingly chill and only slightly triggering episode of STG we talk with our pal Brandi about her experience at an eighteen day occupation of a street in front of a Minneaopolis police station, how life is better when you’ve got friends with you, and we may even convince her to play a song for us, who knows? You’ll have to listen to find out! 

Trigger Warning: child abuse, sex abuse, rape, police brutality, gun violence
